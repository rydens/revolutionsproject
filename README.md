# Revolutions Project
Going off of my coding school's idea of "Hey &lt;teacher>, can I code a quiz game instead of writing a paper?"
This is my quiz game on the French Revolution, along with information. It isn't professional, but I worked hard on it.

## Supa-Mazing Quiz Game Attached
There is even a quiz game built in that uses Raspberry Pi GPIO pins so there are buttons for the answer choices and
lights. 

## You can even learn
With this program, you don't need to go looking for the answers. Before you run the quiz, use the ```learn``` command
from the main menu.
