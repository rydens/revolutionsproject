# Revolutions Project
Going off of my coding school's idea of "Hey &lt;teacher>, can I code a quiz game instead of writing a paper?"
This is my quiz game on the French Revolution, along with information. It isn't professional, but I worked hard on it.



## Supa-Mazing Quiz Game Attached
There is even a quiz game built in that uses Raspberry Pi GPIO pins so there are buttons for the answer choices and
lights. 



## You can even learn
With this program, you don't need to go looking for the answers. Before you run the quiz, use the ```learn``` command
from the main menu.



## Want to run it?
1. Well, first, ya just kinda need a raspberry pi. There are links down below.
2. You also need 5 buttons, 1 large breadboard, 1 small breadbord (other than the one that comes with the pi), 6
   green lights, 6 red lights, 6 yellow lights, and a bunch of extra wires.
3. Clone the program by running ```git clone git@github.com:rydens/revolutionsproject.git```
4. Hook up the lights and buttons using the pins in the file ```project```
5. Run the program ```start```
